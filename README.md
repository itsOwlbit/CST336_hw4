Practice with Node.js and Express.

- App includes 4 of the 5 routes required.
- App still needs to display the Web API (I am using Digimon API)
- App displays data from a Node Package (I am using hacker-quotes package)
- App uses partials (I am using it for header, navbar, and footer)
- There is a navigation menu on all pages (I am using my partial to accomplish this)
- I am using an external CSS file.

Todo:
- [ ] Add another route (sources page)
- [ ] Install node-fetch#2.6
- [ ] Use fetch to display Web API
- [ ] Try to send data to the partials for the Web API and Node Package.
- [ ] Possibly condense to one CSS file.
- [ ] Remove the script.js file
